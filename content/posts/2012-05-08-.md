As a former physics student, I am trained to reduce every theory to as little variables as possible. Although software engineering is inherently complex, there seem to be two major concepts that stand above all. They can be seen as the fundamental reasons, why we (want to) use certain techniques or technologies:

1. Agility

This goal is archivable by reducing transaction costs. The costs (time & money) can be reduced by detecting errors early, not producing too much documentation/requirements, DRY principle, SRP principle)

2. Correctness: Archivable by reducing the possibility of forgotten code (if statements, unit tests, requirements management)
