From <http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/08/09/01/1246201.shtml>:

  * Recruiting for Java posts is a minefield &#8211; it&#8217;s full of people who should be stacking shelves in a supermarket.
  * If you want a Java job, just update your resume to say that you know Java. I have met lots of J2EE experts at work, who would not be able to code a &#8220;Hello World&#8221; program, if their jobs depended on it. Also learn lots of buzz words.
