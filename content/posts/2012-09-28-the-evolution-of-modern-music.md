Are you curiousÂ about the origins of some music genres? Well, I was too. That&#8217;s why I invested many hours reading Wikipedia and created this &#8211; in the meantime pretty comprehensive &#8211; <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/50654595-dadc-49f7-a210-60440ac8f971/image.png" target="_blank">diagram</a> with Lucidchart. Please let me know, if you find an error or you think that an important genre is missing.
