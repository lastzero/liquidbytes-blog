Isn&#8217;t it funny? I couple of hours ago I write about what could happen IF a bank uses a NoSQL database like Cassandra.

I just got an email from my customer, saying that my money got lost during the wire transfer process at the clearing house. What a coincidence! Did that ever happen to you? I never heard about this before. At least the bank will refund the amount, which is really generous xD
