<span class="defaultfont">It&#8217;s not that MS already made an official statement, but from what I read in the news, Microsoft not only started <a href="http://www.iis.net/php">supporting PHP on Windows/IIS</a>. Much more important is, that they are buying companies that use PHP (they could not close some deals yet, but at least they try to):</span>

  * [Yahoo! Inc.][1]
  * [Ciao.com][2]
  * [Facebook][3]

The next logical step is, that Microsoft runs PHP applications and employs a lot of PHP developers. I really don&#8217;t think, they will port all those apps to their own technologies like .net, C# or Visual Basic. So, be prepared. You will soon be able to start a career at Microsoft as PHP developer.
