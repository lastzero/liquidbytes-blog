[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-782" title="Small blinking Google toy" src="http://www.nulldevice.de/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/blinking_google_toy_small.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="78" />][1]I know that mail logs are not the most interesting thing on earth, but I&#8217;m not used to get spam from Google Mail&#8230; from Yahoo and MSN maybe, but not from Google&#8230; never ever&#8230; so I try to understand this:

<tt>May 20 21:43:16 mail postfix/smtpd[30948]: connect from <strong>qb-out-0506.google.com</strong>[72.14.204.235]<br /> May 20 21:43:17 mail postfix/policyd-weight[2754]: weighted check: NOT_IN_SBL_XBL_SPAMHAUS=-1.5 NOT_IN_SPAMCOP=-1.5 NOT_IN_BL_NJABL=-1.5 CL_IP_EQ_HELO_IP=-2 (check from: .gmail. - helo: .qb-out-0506.google. - helo-domain: .google.)

Other people are getting tons of spam from Google as well as it seems.

So why is that? Mmmh&#8230; because the cool and smart engineers at Google can&#8217;t handle their job:

> We would like to clarify to the security community that we have contacted Google about the issue more than a week ago and **no response was provided despite our clear intent of cooperation** regarding this matter.
  
> We have plans to submit a paper about our work on the trust hierarchy of email providers to the [SBSEG&#8217;2008][3] over this weekend. Since the paper will necessarily include full details about the flaw, we see no point on withholding the full disclosure of our self-censored report.
  
>  **We are still waiting to hear from Google** and we sincerely hope that this flaw can be fixed before the full details about the problem are released. ([Source][4])

This was **8 days ago**. Hello? Somebody there!? I&#8217;m 99.99% sure that Google won&#8217;t answer to my spam report. They can&#8217;t even write a small mail to the team that found out how to use Google as open mail relay. Other large providers like T-Online are far more cooperative and they actually answer to your requests.

_&#8220;We are Google. Resistance is a good idea, because: You will be spammed. We will add our spam mail to your mailbox. Your culture will have to learn how to adapt its spam filters.&#8221;_
