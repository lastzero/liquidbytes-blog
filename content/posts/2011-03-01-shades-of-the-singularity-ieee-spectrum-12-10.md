In IEEE Spectrum 12.10 you find an article about building &#8220;The brain of a New Machine&#8221; using Memristors by Versace & Chandler. Bottom line is that they expect that a new memory technology built on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memristor" target="_blank">Memristor</a> chips produced by HP Labs enables them to construct massive-parallel computers that consume only a comparable small amount of energy. While this might be the case, the article does not really answer the question how the software that runs on that hardware looks like. They argue that this &#8220;software&#8221; can not really be called software and that they use some genetic algorithm to find the perfect match between small variations of so called &#8220;animats&#8221;.

That sounds to good to be true.
