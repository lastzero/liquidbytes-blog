    I had heaps of fun with SQL today (again). Ever heard of Common Table Expressions? Here is an example of a recursive query:
    
    <code>
    WITH
      nodeCTE (nodeId, nodeName)
    AS (
      SELECT 
        a.nodeId, 
        nodeName = CONVERT(varchar(8000), nodeName) 
        FROM 
        nodeNames a JOIN nodes b ON a.nodeId = b.nodeId 
        AND a.locale = 'en' AND b.parentId = 0 
      UNION ALL SELECT y.nodeId, 
        x.nodeName + ' -> ' + CONVERT(varchar(8000),
        z.nodeName)
        FROM 
        nodeCTE x JOIN nodes y ON y.parentId = x.nodeId      
        JOIN nodeNames z ON z.nodeId = y.nodeId AND 
        z.locale = 'en'
    )
    SELECT * FROM nodeCTE;
    </code>

I had heaps of fun with SQL today (again). Ever heard of Common Table Expressions? Here is an example of a recursive query:

<pre>WITH
nodeCTE (nodeId, nodeName)
AS (
  SELECT a.nodeId, nodeName = CONVERT(varchar(8000), nodeName)
  FROM nodeNames a
  JOIN nodes b ON a.nodeId = b.nodeId AND a.locale = 'en' AND b.parentId = 0
  UNION ALL SELECT y.nodeId, x.nodeName + ' -&gt; ' + CONVERT(varchar(8000), z.nodeName)
  FROM nodeCTE x JOIN nodes y ON y.parentId = x.nodeId
  JOIN nodeNames z ON z.nodeId = y.nodeId AND z.locale = 'en'
)
SELECT * FROM nodeCTE;
</pre>

Another task was to create a database record in the locale &#8216;de&#8217;, if it did not exist yet:

<pre>INSERT INTO users
(userId, locale, title, firstName, lastName, middleName, nobleName, displayName, email)
SELECT userId, 'de', title, firstName, lastName, middleName, nobleName, displayName, email
FROM users b
WHERE locale = 'en' AND NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT NULL
  FROM mdb_users a
  WHERE a.userId = b.userId AND locale = 'de'
);
</pre>

Afterwards, it was easy to eliminate all special (German) characters from the original records in the default locale &#8216;en&#8217;.
  
Did you know that there is a major difference between German and English is the abbreviation for &#8220;Doctor&#8221;, which is &#8220;Dr&#8221; in English and &#8220;Dr.&#8221; in German? That had to be fixed too:

<pre>UPDATE users
SET title = REPLACE(title, 'Dr.', 'Dr')
WHERE locale = 'en';
</pre>

Last query example is a search for name parts and the phone extension. You had to search in all locales of the multi-lingual database, but only return distinct results in the locale &#8216;en&#8217; with Name und Initial:

<pre>SELECT displayName, initial
FROM users
WHERE locale = 'en'
AND userId IN (
  SELECT userId
  FROM users
  WHERE (lastName LIKE '%example%' OR
    firstName LIKE '%example%' OR
    middleName LIKE '%example%' OR
    nobleName LIKE '%example%' OR
    title LIKE '%example%' OR
    initial LIKE '%example%')
  UNION SELECT userId
  FROM userAddresses
  WHERE adrPhoneExt = '%example%'
)
ORDER BY lastName
</pre>
