It is a misconception, if developers think that agile methods do not require any written documents. Here are a few (I think the most important) examples:

  * A **Wiki** that contains the steps required to **set up** the application and a list of **config files** and **config options** can be considered essencial documentation &#8211; especially for developers who join the project at a later time. Also I would strongly recommend documenting the **basic architecture** (for example the different layers like database, storage backend, front-end application and JavaScript user-interface &#8211; how do they communicate with each other?).
  * Of course it makes sense to write down the **core features** to be implemented for each story, so that the developer knows what to do in detail. Otherwise, you can hardly **estimate** the scope of your tasks and/or you rely on the **memory** of a certain developer (you&#8217;re in trouble, if that person gets sick or leaves the project for other reasons). Many product owners think, it&#8217;s enough to describe the task with like 5 sentences. **Wireframes** and a list of possible **user interactions** are a good start and also help a lot during **acceptance testing** after the features were implemented.
  * You should definitively document all implemented **protocols** for reference. **Sequence diagrams** are often useful for that. Even many standard protocols have optional features and 2 years later, no one will know what is implemented and what not. If you publish a public **API**, you have to document it in every case. APIs can often be documented half-automated using **reflection** and **inline comments**.
  * What you should **not** document, is the **code as such**, because it changes a lot (refactoring) so that the documentation will be **outdated**, **useless** and even **dangerous** really quick. If you care about basic **usability**, the front-end should also not require any documentation. When was the last time, you read a user&#8217;s guide to use a Web site?
