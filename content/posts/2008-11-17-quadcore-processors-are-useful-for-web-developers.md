Every now and then you read, that the maximum you need on a desktop are two cores and that quadcore mainly is a nice marketing idea. That&#8217;s probably true, if you use Word or Games mainly. For Word, even an Intel Atom processor is enough. As a Web developer which usually has some batch jobs running, a database, memached, Eclipse, Firefox and VMware with Windows to do tests, you will see that the four cores are worth the money, however!
