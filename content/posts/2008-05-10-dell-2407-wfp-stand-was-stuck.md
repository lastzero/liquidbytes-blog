> I was getting ready to pack my monitor up to move it the other day, and I pushed the release button for the mount on the monitor stand. A second or two after the monitor was disengaged from the stand, I heard a loud &#8220;twang&#8221; coming from the stand. I didn&#8217;t think much of it because it looked fine, but later on I found it was stuck, in the lowest position.

I had the same problem with my display and tried to solve it on smart way for months. After virtually fixing everything else in my flat, I started working on this problem again today. I hate unsolved problems. As there were no other options left, I used the &#8220;hammer method&#8221; and there we go! :)
