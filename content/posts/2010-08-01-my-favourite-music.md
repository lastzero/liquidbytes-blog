After waiting for 29 years, I finally feel like I know what my all-time favourite music is &#8211; I been thinking about this a lot lately. Isn&#8217;t this one of the most frequently asked questions when you meet new people? Ok, maybe not on a computer conference or in the office. Anyways, I can be a nerd next time and give them a link to this page&#8230;
