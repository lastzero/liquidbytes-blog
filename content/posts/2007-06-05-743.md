See http://www.nulldevice.eu/php/grou.ps.php, if you want to know how it looks rendered. They could have done a better job by including more confusing HTML tags, XXS bugs and errors to the php source (why not using a PHP 5 class?), but hey, it&#8217;s ok! Should the missing &#8220;&& $q7&#8221; in the if clause count as an error?
