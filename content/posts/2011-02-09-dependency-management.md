Right now, I try to find out what works best for me &#8211; in all areas. For example:

  * Keep the Facebook account or delete it?
  * Teach people about SQL and JS or keep it to myself?
  * Get in touch with people from the past or ignore them?
  * Enjoy the nightlife in Berlin or sit at home every evening and live healthy?
  * Use git or Subversion?
  * Wear black cloths or more colorful stuff?
  * Get a new car or wait until my Civic dies?
  * Listen to music or enjoy the silence?

These are really tough questions and I won&#8217;t be able to answer them without breakfast. This is what the title refers to.
