If somebody ever said, there is no memory leak in Firefox, here&#8217;s the proof:

<span style="color: #551a8b;"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2234/2519624567_8fb99fa8a9_o.png" alt="Firefox memory leak" width="372" height="80" /></span>

It can&#8217;t be, that a browser with 4 open tabs requires about 600 MB of memory. That&#8217;s 150 MB per Web site, which seems a bit too much ;)

Safari, by the way, requires 128 MB for 5 open tabs.

> If you find that Firefox&#8217;s memory usage continues to grow after long periods of being open, you may want to consider periodically restarting Firefox to bring the memory usage back to reasonable levels.
