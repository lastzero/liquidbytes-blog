There was a posting re [&#8220;Mozilla&#8217;s Thought On Google&#8217;s Chrome&#8221;][1] on Slashdot today&#8230; which has a comment that underlines what I wrote earlier:

> IMHO, the real target is MS Office. Google makes their money from advertising, which means eyeballs and correlated data. Unfortunately for them, many people spend a majority of their day inside MS Word and MS Excel and other apps. Google would love to have those eyeballs and all that data to better shape their profiles and thus better deliver advertising. What better way than to get all those different apps to &#8220;occur&#8221; inside the browser?
