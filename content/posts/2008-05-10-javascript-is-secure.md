At least that&#8217;s what I was told on the Google Developers Day last year. Now I find headlines like <a rel="external" href="http://securitylabs.websense.com/content/Alerts/3070.aspx" target="_blank">Mass Attack JavaScript injection</a>. Bugzilla also lists about 20 possibly exploitable bugs in the Firefox JavaScript engine for the last 12 months. But hey, don&#8217;t block JavaScript! You would miss the wunderful [AdSense][1] and [Content Match][2]{.on} ads ;)
