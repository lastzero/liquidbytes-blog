I forgot to mention why I had to install Privoxy (see my last post): Because I started using Safari, which doesn&#8217;t care about my privacy and security in the same way as Firefox does. Sadly, Firefox crashes every couple of minutes since the last update. Another reason for using Safari is it&#8217;s JavaScript performance:

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-791" title="jQuery, YUI and Dojo JS selector performance" src="https://blog.liquidbytes.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/graph-3.png" alt="uery, YUI and Dojo JS selector performance" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/graph-3.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2008/05/graph-3-500x385.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />

The results show the final time in ms for the tests on <http://www.domassistant.com/slickspeed/>.

I&#8217;ve also done the same test on my Linux notebook (which is of course a bit slower than the 64bit Windows XP workstation) with Opera, Epiphany and Firefox:

Still, the Webkit engine is the fastest! So go and try for yourself.
