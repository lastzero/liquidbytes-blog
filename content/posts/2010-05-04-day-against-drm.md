Yesterday, I read that **1 million iPads** and **12 million DRM protected iPad apps** were already sold by Apple. So I don&#8217;t feel welcome starting that discussion again. I have an iPhone as well, to be honest. Even though my Palm Pre Plus arrives today. Let&#8217;s see if that works for me and if the device is less evil. Anyways:

I guess the thing is that **there were always activists** that bought their [bananas][2] and [coffee][3] in that special fair trade store a couple of miles away. And there are the &#8220;normal&#8221; people, that just don&#8217;t care and buy their stuff in the super market round the corner. Of course their bananas were sometimes full of poison and of course the coffee farmers in Africa were badly exploited. On the other hand, the bananas are looking nice and the coffee is cheap. You can&#8217;t do anything about it and if you do, you are treated like the enemy of the working class. Because, obviously, poor people don&#8217;t have the money to buy the expensive fair trade product and others just want convenience after their 14h working day. That makes the whole issue a bit more complicated.

So yeah, there we are. At least it&#8217;s time to think again, before we (who can afford it) decide to buy the next product that is [defective by design][4] like the Apple iPad. A lot has changed already, for example Amazon sells DRM-free MP3 files, which was unthinkable a couple of years ago. I really enjoy to buy my music there and IMO it&#8217;s a lot more user friendly than iTunes.
