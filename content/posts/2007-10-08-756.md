    Hey ho, I'm a proud member of [http://nosoproject.com/?author=1241 NOSO] now... bad thing is, that the meetings are in San Fransisco only ;(
    
    Why not start a similar non-social-network for Germany? That's exactly what I need! Forget about XING, Myspace, StudiVZ, Facebook,... those sites absorb your time like a black hole... impoverishment at a high level... watching television instead is no better... what I want is time to relax from the constant information flow... SMS, Instant Messages, Emails, Mailinglists, Blogs,... I can't really stand it anymore ;)
