After 8 lost years, the US might finally be back on track. As one of my colleagues in the US put it:
  
_&#8220;:) I woke up today thinking things are going back to normal&#8221;_
  
Another one said:
  
_&#8221; I certainly hope there is anything but normal! Obama inspires people to be better. It is time for the US to be less selfish, and more global citizen. I cannot wait! :)&#8221;_
