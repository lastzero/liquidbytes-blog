As posted on Facebook and Twitter, my good old **Nokia E51** was stolen last night. I still got that **Palm Pre Plus**, but the battery life is too short for daily usage and the form factor is also not very comfortable for normal phone calls. It&#8217;s a smart phone, not a convenient one. So again, I have to deal with the Nr 1 topic of the western society: **Which mobile phone do I want?** Damn it.

The good news is: T-Mobile will provide me with a new SIM card next week, so that I can keep the number. Until I get it, you have to talk with my voice mailbox (all messages will be deleted). If you have anything important to say, please write an email! :)

Who will bother stealing a Nokia E51 with Arabian keypad in Germany? It is risky to sell a unique phone like this on eBay and on the street, they will not make a fortune. Whatever.
