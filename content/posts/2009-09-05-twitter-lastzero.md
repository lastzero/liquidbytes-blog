Wow, after years, I managed to create a twitter account this week. @williamluciw invited me. It&#8217;s much easier to write short tweets from time to time, than updating a blog with interesting content. On the other hand, it&#8217;s a waste of time.

The best use case I found so far, is to tell the world about things I like, things I don&#8217;t like, or bugs I find in more or less popular applications/Web sites. Stuff that would not be worth writing a full featured blog post about.

Anyway, have a nice weekend and don&#8217;t waste too much time with the internet!
