A white Apple iPhone 4S arrived today via UPS Express. I got it to replace my iPod touch, mainly because of the camera:

  * I can confirm that the picture quality is quite acceptable, for a phone.
  * However the most prominent (negative) feature of the iPhone is the bigger size and weight compared to the iPod. Of course you can also get that, if you buy one of the predecessors of the 4S.
  * Also I like the white color.  You don&#8217;t see the fingerprints so easily ;)
  * Free entertainment: It takes a while to understand how your privacy is compromised by iCloud (so many features to turn on and off)
