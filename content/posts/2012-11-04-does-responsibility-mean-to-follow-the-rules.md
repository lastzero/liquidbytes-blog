<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2179" title="Responsibility & Control" src="https://lastzero.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/control.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="182" />There&#8217;s a **misconception about responsibility** that probably starts to establish in our brains during childhood. When we grow up, we get taught that responsibility means to **follow the established rules** of society (including our parents and the various educational institutions), which indeed **is a good start**. Now, the challenges we face in large software projects are much **more complex** and dynamic. The solutions can not be found in **simple rules** like doing your homework every day. Still, managers and also (to my surprise) many engineers are looking for **simple panaceas** to solve their problems automatically.

> _Agile_ processes are not a _panacea_ and they are not _easy_ to implement. [&#8230;] These processes focus on code rather than documentation calling themselves agile because, unlike the traditional processes, they are adaptable, not rigid.

Organizations and projects are **highly dynamic systems** that need to be **understood** and **analyzed**. You can then start to react and **make changes** that hopefully lead in the right direction. The agile manifesto says &#8220;we value **responding to change** over following a plan&#8221;.

The idea behind true responsibility is to be able to **observe** and **control** the system you are responsible for. In cybernetics, it is called a **feedback loop**. This is exactly why implementing an agile process is the opposite of **following the rules correctly**. If you want to be successful, you must **measure the results** of your actions and **adapt the rules** accordingly.

If you put people in a **responsible position** but don&#8217;t give them **full control**, you either cause a **conflict** or, if you were successful, you **block their natural problem solving mechanism**. This usually happens before systems **fail badly**.

It is true, some common rules in the area of software engineering and agile management require **pedantic exactness** and **rigor** to lead to good results. But **professional responsibility** starts with **measuring** these results and **adapting the rules** accordingly. Although there are many **well-written books** out there, finding solutions that work has a lot to do with **practical experience**. Managers and team members must give the **freedom to control** to those, who are supposed to be responsible.
