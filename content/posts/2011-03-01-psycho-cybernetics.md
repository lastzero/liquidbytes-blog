It is always interesting to see, what we &#8220;forgot&#8221; during history. One of the these things is, without a doubt, [Cybernetics][1] (which in turn is a child of the 2nd world war) and maybe even the origin of computers (see [von Neumann architecture][2]), which is closely coupled to that.

While passing by a second-hand bookstore in Evanston, IL I saw the book Psycho-Cybernetics in the window, which was published in 1960, 12 years after Cybernetics was published by Norbert Wiener. Apparently Cybernetics was a popular and well-known term at that time.

The flight back to Germany will give opportunity to read through this book, but the preface already looks promising:

> Our present state of self-confidence and poise is the result of what we have &#8220;experienced&#8221; rather than what we have learned intellectually. [&#8230;] Actual, real-life experience can be a hard and ruthless teacher.

Some might say this is common sense, but many people don&#8217;t act like that and IMO our schools still don&#8217;t focus enough on creative experiencing but rather try to go the intellectual way of learning everything out of a book.

Just as a side note: As an outcome of the cold war, the Cybernetics hype was replaced by the [Artificial Intelligence][3] hype. At least this was mentioned in the Wikipedia article about AI, which is more than I expected:

> In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of researchers explored the connection between [neurology][4], [information theory][5], and [cybernetics][6]. Some of them built machines that used electronic networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as [W. Grey Walter][7]&#8216;s [turtles][8] and the [Johns Hopkins Beast][9]. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings of the Teleological Society at [Princeton University][10] and the[Ratio Club][11] in England.<sup id="cite_ref-AI.27s_immediate_precursors_20-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#cite_note-AI.27s_immediate_precursors-20">[21]</a></sup> By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned, although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#Cybernetics_and_brain_simulation" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>)

What they don&#8217;t write is that it was abandoned for political and financial rather than scientific reasons.

The von Neumann architecture could be replaced by new massive-parallel architectures built around the [memristor][12], see one of my last posts and then, maybe we can finally [transfer our minds into a computer][13] ;)

Anyhow, I just think it&#8217;s sad how much knowledge and context gets lost over time, despite the fact that we&#8217;re living in a knowledge-society and the Internet enabled us to get all the information we want. But people are (of course) interested in hypes and books written decades ago don&#8217;t seem to be relevant anymore.
