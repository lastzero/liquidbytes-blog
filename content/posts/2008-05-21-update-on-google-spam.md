I love short mails with a clear message :)

_&#8220;Google&#8217;s chronic silence on all abuse reports makes it impossible to tell whether they&#8217;ve taken any action on the problem, whether the problem reports have even made it to the operational staff responsible for the mailservers, or whether they simply don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m sure you can all make your own snarky comments re &#8216;Do no evil&#8217;.&#8221; (_[BugTraq][1]_)_

Don&#8217;t forget: Google offers a **fast paced** and dynamic work environment \*rofl\*
