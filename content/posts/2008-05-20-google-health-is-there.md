Now, you can share your sensitive information about the following with Google (I got the list from the authorization agreement on google.com):

  * HIV or AIDS
  * Mental illness or any mental health condition
  * Alcohol or substance abuse
  * Sexually transmitted diseases
  * Pregnancy
  * Abortion or other family planning
  * Genetic tests or genetic diseases

Isn&#8217;t that exactly what we&#8217;re all after? I think I will add Alcohol, HIV and Pregnancy to my profile and see what happens \*lol\*

Maybe I can combine [Google Health][1] with Google Analytics and see if the visitors to my blog share the same &#8220;health condition&#8221;&#8230;
