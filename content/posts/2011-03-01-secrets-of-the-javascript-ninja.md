OnÂ <http://www.manning.com/resig/resig_meapch1.pdf> you find the first chapter of John Resigs new book &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.de/Secrets-JavaScript-Ninja-John-Resig/dp/193398869X" target="_blank">Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja</a>&#8220;. From what I can see there, the book can be a useful reference, but it does not look like there are any actual secrets revealed. All the bread & butter topics seem covered and John certainly understands JavaScript.

I think every experienced JavaScript developers agrees with his statement:

> Browser-based JavaScript development is much more complicated than it seems.

Except that I don&#8217;t like the word &#8220;complicated&#8221;. When developers say something is complicated, it means they are too lazy to think about it and/or that they want somebody else to implement a feature. Instead I would say:

> Browser-based JavaScript development requires more attention to detail than usual server-side programming languages.
