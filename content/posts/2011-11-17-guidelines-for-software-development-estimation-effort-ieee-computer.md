An analysis of 32 factors that influence the software development estimation accuracy can be found in Computer’s October issue (Dirk Basten, Ali Sunyaev, pp. 88-90).

In my opinion, these are the most important results:

  * Try to exclude candidates with a high general degree of **optimism** as well as optimism in the estimation process
  * **Split larger tasks into smaller ones**, which can usually be estimated more precisely
  * **Communicate frequently** with the client to obtain direct feedback
  * Estimator **experience is one of the most important factors** in archiving development effort estimation accuracy, although it&#8217;s impractical to appoint the highest-qualified estimator on every project
