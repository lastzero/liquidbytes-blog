Thanks for all the feedback concerning my last post about project and task estimation. I really appreciate it! :)

These are indeed the best practices I found so far and I would not recommend them, if they didn&#8217;t work or I found any better way of doing things. It doesn&#8217;t mean I wouldn&#8217;t enjoy working in a successful project that does things differently or learn about other experiences.

There are no panaceas in agile development (other than doing your unit tests). As paul Paul Oldfield on Linkedin wrote: It always depends on the context, which I didn&#8217;t mention enough in an earlier version of my blog post. I do things quickly and refactor later&#8230;
