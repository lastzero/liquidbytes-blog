excerpt: "When it comes to Web search, everybody thinks of Google nowadays. But there are shortcomings: Google has just one large index for all users. This is why search engine optimization has become so popular and why you sometimes don't find what you're looking for. A possible solution would be to have different indexes, maintained by the users, that cover the various needs (e.g. topics, regions, content quality,...). That way, a user can decide to only get search results from Germany without ads, for example. Of course one large monolithic company could have problems to provide such a service."

When it comes to Web search, everybody thinks of Google nowadays. But there are shortcomings: Google has just one large index for all users. This is why search engine optimization has become so popular and why you sometimes don&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for. A possible solution would be to have different indexes, maintained by the users, that cover the various needs (e.g. topics, regions, content quality,&#8230;). That way, a user can decide to only get search results from Germany without ads, for example. Of course one large monolithic company could have problems to provide such a service. This is the point where peer-to-peer search comes into play. I think shared and categorized bookmark lists are the start of a trend to individualize information search and organization. The question is just, how fast the required technology develops.
