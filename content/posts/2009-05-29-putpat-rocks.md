Yes, this site is cool. It plays all your favourite music videos, just like M-TV or Viva did a couple of years ago, but based on what YOU like (last.fm integration \*yeah\*) and without ads for mobile phone ring tones. The only bug I found so far, is that the default gender is female &#8211; an empty field would be less confusing maybe. Also a fast internet connection is required probably. My 32 MBit line does not make any trouble of course.

Some newspaper wrote that putpat is the next revolution after youtube. Might well be, after what I&#8217;ve seen. Basically people go to youtube and click one video after another. Putput selects the right videos for you and there&#8217;s no interruption between the clips. Very convenient :)

See for yourself!
