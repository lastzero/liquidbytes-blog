While searching for some background information about the pros and cons of Google Web Toolkit (the German social network &#8220;StudiVZ&#8221; wants to use it now, because they think it&#8217;s cool), I came across lots of blogs of ex-Googlers. It feels like every employee that quits, writes at least 3 posts about it and places a prominent link on their home page &#8211; and then thousands of news portals are quoting it. Just google for &#8220;ex google employee&#8221;. You&#8217;ll get almost 27 million hits! If you search for &#8220;google rejected interview&#8221; you&#8217;ll only get about 9 million hits. When telling my friends what I observe, they sometimes wonder why they&#8217;ve never been contacted by a Google recruiter, which is another form of talking about Google.

What I want to say is: As strange as it seems how inferior people feel after they leave Google, get rejected or not even contacted by Google &#8211; at least people respect this company a lot and it would be way worse (from a PR standpoint), if nobody talks about them.

Anyhow: Using the GWT to build cool apps (not just intranet portals) doesn&#8217;t seem to be fun and it is a good reason to look for a job outside of Google. [JavaScriptMVC][1] is so much better! :P
