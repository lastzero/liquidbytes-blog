Thorsten Rinne just published the new version of phpMyFaq. But probably he didn&#8217;t read the notifications during development time and now they pop up on the <a href="http://faq.phpmyfaq.de/news/11/en/upgrade-to-phpmyfaq-263.html" target="_blank">live site</a> and break everything:

> phpMyFAQ notice [8]: Object of class PMF\_DB\_Mysql could not be converted to int in Captcha.php on line 150

It&#8217;s not that I am perfect. My colleges sometimes have to remind me to turn on notifications, because the automatic PHP updates turned them off or I switched computers and forgot to modify the local php.ini. This can happen to everyone.
