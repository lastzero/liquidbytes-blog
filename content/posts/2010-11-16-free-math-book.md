Yesterday, I migrated my personal math reference to the new Wiki:

[http://math.chaoticpattern.net/wiki/index][1]

It is all in German and with my own clumsy comments. Those who read it, will notice that math is a useful tool for me, rather than some kind of art &#8211; although I agree you can look at it as art, if you got the time. That&#8217;s why I tried to compress it as much as possible ;)
