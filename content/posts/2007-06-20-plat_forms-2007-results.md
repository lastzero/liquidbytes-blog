    The [http://www.plat-forms.org/2007/documents/platformsTR.pdf results of the plat_forms contest] are finally published! PHP was the best platform in terms of completeness, maintainablity and security. Also, the differences between the PHP teams were small compared to Perl and Java - that means, our **Team 8** was quite good, even if OXID (Team 6) is the winning team for PHP: Congratulations :)
    
    I'd like to mention that we had almost no defects in our solution:

Here&#8217;s a quote from page 47:

> &#8220;Team8 PHP has excellent correctness with just one single mistake in the search usecase, only one fourth as many defects as the runner-up. Team4 Javaâ€™s defect weight is also quite small (but should be viewed relative to the lower amount of functionality implemented) and team2 Perl is best on the Perl platform (because team5 Perl&#8217;s problems more often concern MUST requirements).&#8221;
