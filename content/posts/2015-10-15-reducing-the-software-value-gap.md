Research shows at least 50% of IT developers&#8217; time is wastedÂ due to the following reasons:

<ul class="acm" style="color: #444444;">
  <li style="color: #000000;">
    Rework due to incomplete or poorly defined needs and requirements (&#8220;incomplete kit&#8221;);
  </li>
  <li style="color: #000000;">
    Rework due to frequent changes in requirements and scope up to the final delivery stages; most such changes are not &#8220;must have&#8221; but only &#8220;nice to have&#8221;;
  </li>
  <li style="color: #000000;">
    Software solutions developed and delivered but eventually not used (happens all too often);
  </li>
  <li style="color: #000000;">
    Over-specification of requirements to include functionality and features seldom or never applied; and
  </li>
  <li style="color: #000000;">
    Having too many activities assigned to individual developers, leading to wasteful context switching among activities (bad multitasking).
  </li>
</ul>
