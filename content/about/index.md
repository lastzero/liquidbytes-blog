Liquid Bytes was founded by Michael Mayer in 1997 as a software company specialized in content management systems, open-source solutions and Web hosting.
Clients included small and medium-sized businesses as well as public organizations such as the University of Tübingen and the Department of Trade and Industry Baden-Württemberg.

From 2006 until 2009, Michael joined Zend Technologies as a freelance consultant and decided not to continue Liquid Bytes as a full service provider.
With his many years of experience in the software business, he's now focused on helping his clients build rock-solid Web applications,
leverage the full potential of agile software development and master management challenges.
