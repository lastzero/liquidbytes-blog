My first contact with Web technologies was at the University of Tübingen in 1993. Four years later I founded *Liquid Bytes*, a software company specializing in content management systems and open-source solutions. It was discontinued as a full-service provider after joining *Zend Technologies* from 2006 until 2009.

In the following years it became my passion to help teams succeed even in difficult situations by focusing on sustainability and continuous improvement.
